## Wiki features

This wiki uses the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax. The [MarkDownDemo tutorial](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo) shows how various elements are rendered. The [Bitbucket documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FA4zDQ) has more information about using a wiki.

The wiki itself is actually a git repository, which means you can clone it, edit it locally/offline, add images or any other file type, and push it back to us. It will be live immediately.

Have fun!
